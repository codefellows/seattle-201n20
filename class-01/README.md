# Introduction to Development

## Lecture

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 1 of Code 201, students will be able to:

- create a HTML page from scratch, with proper HTML5 hierarchical structure conventions, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- properly include a \<script> tag in an HTML document that will interact with the user via prompt/alert, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- write JavaScript that will interact with the user via prompt/alert, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- use the command line to create and change directories, create and list files, and open files in a text editor and in a web browser, as demonstrated by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- install & use plugins for their text editor, including a minimap and a JavaScript linter, as measured by observations of the instructional staff

## Kickoff

This is the welcome and introduction to Code Fellows. You will meet the campus manager and learn about campus operations and policies.

## Academic Overview

The instructor will give an overview of the topics to be covered in this course and how those topics fit into the overall academic program at Code Fellows.

## Unix & Git

Introduction to core the concepts of file management from the command line and the fundamentals of Git and GitHub.

- `pwd` = present working directory
- `tree`  = shows the filetree of your directory
- `ls`, `ls -la`  = list all the files and folders located in your current directory
- `cd` = change directory
- `mkdir` = make directory  
- `touch` = create a new file
- `code`  = open up this file in VSCode
- `mv` = move a file
- `rm` = remove a file
- `cp`  = copy a file

## Set up a JavaScript linter

Setup your linter by opening your terminal and type `cd` to navigate to their home directory. Then type `code .eslintrc.json`, which will create a new file called `.eslintrc.json` and open it in VSCode. You should then paste the contents of the `.eslintrc.json` file, which is located in the root of the class repository.

## Additional VSCode Settings

In the lower left-hand corner of VSCode, click on the gear icon and select "Settings". Use the search functionality to set the following values:

- "editor.tabSize" should be set to 2
- "editor.detectIndentation" should be set to true
- "editor.wordWrap" should be set to "on"
- "editor.minimap.enabled" should be set to true
